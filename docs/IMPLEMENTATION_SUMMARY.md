# Implementation Summary: Workshop Categories and User Academic Fields

## Overview
This implementation adds a new `category` field to the workshops table and four new academic fields to the users table:
- `university` (text, nullable)
- `department` (text, nullable) 
- `academic_year` (text, nullable)
- `academic_session` (text, nullable)

- All other categories use standard enrollment form

### 3. Admin Management

- Comprehensive user management with academic fields
- Filtering and search capabilities for both workshops and users

## Database Migration Instructions
